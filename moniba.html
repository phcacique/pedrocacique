            <h1>Moniba</h1>
            <p><strong>iOS app</strong> - In 2019, the Apple Developer Academies were invited to create solutions for the Gulmakai Champions, the network of leaders of social programs from The Malala Fund.</p>
            <p>
                We ran a great ideation process, close to representatives from the Malala Fund and Apple. At the end, we came with 4 different ideas to help the <em>Champions</em> in their daily work.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of this ideas is <strong>Moniba</strong>. The name comes from Malala's best friend, who was there for her since the beginning of her story as activist.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app's goal is to help the <em>Champions</em> to share their activities among their network, showing what they are doing and what kind of help they need.
            </p>
            <p>Moniba is more than a virtual assistant, she is a friend!</p>
            <p>
                This app is not available at the open App Store. It is only available to the <em>Champions</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I act as PO and main developer. Contributing also with some illustrations and helped on the design creation.
