        <h1>Generative Art</h1>
        <p>
            This form of artistic expression is made by code. The artist establishes a set of rules to be followed by the algorithm in order to generate his piece of art. It may or may not be interactive, have movement, sound or graphics. It all depends on the work of art. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here I present some of the results of my experiments in this field. They were made in Swift, on the Playgrounds App and exported as image to this gallery.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to check the code I wrote, please subscribe to my Playground Subscription feed, or access My GitHub page to fork it.

                <h1>00</h1>
                <p><strong>10Print</strong> - This is one of the first Generative Art expressions, written in basic, in 1982. My version was written in Swift.

                <p><strong>Perspective</strong> - The idea of this piece was create the illusion of 3D using only 2D shapes.

                <h1>02</h1>
                <p><strong>Circles</strong> - What can I do using circles in a finit loop?

                <h1>03</h1>
                <p><strong>Vertigo</strong> - Did you got dizzy too? A finite matrix of circles with a small displacement in each iteration.

                <h1>04</h1>
                <p><strong>Star</strong> - Made by several concentric geometric figures. You can change the shape by varying the number of sides of each polygon.

                <p><strong>Combined Shapes</strong> - Lissajous figures, created by combining movements from different shapes.
